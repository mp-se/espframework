# ESP framework

This is a framework that I use in my own ESP projects as a base. It contains a lot of basic features that are needed. It has been tested with the following targets: ESP8266, ESP32, ESP32S2, ESP32C3, ESP32S3

## Structure

The master branch dones not contain any code. There are a number of version of the framework which is stored in seprate branches for easy maintenance

### Branch 1.0

- This is the current version used in my projects for Arduino 2.x

### Branch 1.1

- Updated with newer version of the dependant libraries like Arduino Json 7 and Async Webserver for Arduino 2.x

- ArduinoLog has now been merged into the library for easier maintenance.

- Note! This is currently under development and testing.

### Branch 2,0

- Based on 1.1 this is migreted to work with Arduino 3.x

- Note! This is currently under development and testing.
